This module allows an application to use cexpsh() instead
of iocsh from 'main'. Currently relevant and supported on
Linux only.

To use this module:

   - add and entry in your application's RELEASE file pointing
     to this module.

   - your application's 'main' may look like this:

       #include <iocsh.h>
       #include <epicsThread.h>
       #include <epicsExit.h>

       #ifdef HAVE_CEXP
       #include <cexp.h>
       #endif

       int
       main(int argc, char **argv)
       {
       #ifdef HAVE_CEXP
         cexp_main(argc, argv);
       #else
         if ( argc >= 2 ) {
           iocsh(argv[1]);
           epicsThreadSleep(0.2);
         }
         iocsh(NULL);
       #endif
         epicsExit();
         return 0;
       }

     Some makefile magic provided by this module automatically
     defines HAVE_CEXP on platforms where cexpsh is available.

   - Your application's Makefile must link the cexp (and dependent)
     libraries. Again, the makefile magic defines CEXP_LIBS only
     when applicable:

         <myApp>_LIBS += $(CEXP_LIBS)

NOTES:
   1 when adding this module on a platform where it can be used
     a STATIC_BUILD is enforced. Cexpsh() cannot look up symbols
     in dynamic libraries unless a special symbol table is built.
     This is not implemented in the makefile logic ATM.

   2 No special symbol table is built - hence only symbols defined
     by the main application (not shared libs see 1) are 'known'
     to the shell.
     Your application's Makefile may enforce linking symbols which
     are not referenced by your app by adding

         -Wl,-u,<symbol>

     to the linker flags.

BUILDING THIS MODULE
====================

In order to build this module you must install the CEXP
sources in a subdirectory of $(TOP)/cexp/<subdir> and define

CEXP_VERS=<subdir>

in $(TOP)/cexp/Makefile accordingly. If you are working
with a CVS checkout then the CEXP package must be prepared:

  chdir $(TOP)/cexp/<subdir>
  make prep

This requires 'bison' and recent autotools.

A released tarball of CEXP does not need this preparation 
step.

After installing the sources, chdir to $(TOP) and issue
'make' as usual.
