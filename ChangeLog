20130123 (T.S.):
 - cexp/cexpSup.c: must terminate argument list to 'cexpsh()' with a NULL.
 - README: updated
 - cexp/Makefile, configure/CONFIG_CEXP.in: list the libraries implemented or linked by cexp
   in CEXP_DEPLIBS (was CEXP_LIBS). CEXP_DEPLIBS is architecture-
   dependent (empty where there is no cexp). The support library
   'libcexpSup' is always present (but may be empty) so that the
   module can be used on any architecture w/o causing compiler or
   linker errors. The application still adds $(CEXP_LIBS) from its
   Makefile.
 - cexp/Makefile, cexp/cexpSup.c, configure/CONFIG_CEXP.in,
   demo/Makefile, cexp/cexpSup.dbd:
   New: cexpsh module now features a dbd file. App must add $(CEXP_DBDS)
   to its DBD. The dbd adds a registrar which adds entry points for
   cexpsh to iocsh so that the former may be called from the latter.
